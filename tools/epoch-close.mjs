// epoch-close.mjs — the funding seam's founder tool (keeping pots, S1/S2).
//
// MANUAL by design: not cron, not settlement-riding. The founder runs it with
// the office key when an epoch's dollars are in. Three verbs and a reader:
//
//   --receipt   witness one real-dollar payment against a pot (mint-at-entry:
//               a re-recorded ref bounces loudly; D5: so does a payment past
//               the pot's posted target, unless the pot is marked uncapped)
//   --grant     record direct-to-town dollars (the reserved `treasury` pot):
//               appends ONE ordinary pot-receipt and nothing else — no stakes,
//               no close, and so no holo ever mints against it. The founding
//               family grant is this verb's first use. It is its own verb rather
//               than a flag on --receipt because the treasury posts no need, so
//               the intake gate that refuses dollars past a target has nothing
//               to measure and must not run.
//   --close     close one pot for one epoch: derive the returns-and-rewards
//               block (deriveEpochClose in stamp-mint.mjs — the ONE copy
//               of the law, shared with the verifier), print the human-legible
//               epoch report, and append the whole block atomically (one signed
//               write). --dry-run (or no --key) prints the report and the
//               would-be lines, appends nothing. REBUILT 2026-09-17 under the
//               09-14 amendment (every open stake returns whole; nothing burns;
//               the mass sizes the givers' mint) and the founder's 09-17 ruling
//               (the givers' reward IS the holo row, and holo stamps are liquid).
//   --unstake   take a resident's OWN open keeping stake back out of a pot,
//               before any close (founder-ruled 2026-09-17, after a site bug
//               placed the same stake twice: "just unstake it by hand please,
//               we don't need a whole engine for it"). One row, one hand, no
//               derivation. It clips to the staker's own open position on that
//               pot — never another resident's, never more than stands — and it
//               is NOT a close: it names no epoch, so the pot's epoch is still
//               open afterwards and the close that eventually runs is unaffected.
//               --dry-run prints the line and appends nothing.
//   --holo-held read any household's holo — how much of its mint came from the
//               funding seam. Since 2026-09-17 this is a SOURCE readout, not a
//               separate holding: those stamps are in the balance and in the
//               mint count like any other, and this says where they came from.
//   --keeping-held  the same for the retired keeping mint (no σ leg since
//               2026-09-14; the live ledger holds no such row). Kept so the
//               history reads back.
//   --ownership D1: "ownership is a derived READ". With holo inside
//               minted-cumulative it IS the all-sources mint; holo is the source
//               column beside it, never a second addend.
//
// The law it enforces is § 8 of the 2026-08-20 capture doc, as corrected
// 2026-08-21 (matching prices against the pot's POSTED NEED, and the σ leg
// returns to the stakers themselves) and then ALIGNED to that day's later
// rulings — R10 (ρ), R12 (the σ leg IS mint, and counts in the ρ base), D1
// (ownership is a read), D5 (intake refuses past target). See the grammar block
// in stamp-mint.mjs (THE FUNDING SEAM), which quotes the ruling sentences.
//
// σ and ρ are READ from ECONOMY-DIALS.json law_side.keeping, never restated
// here: R10 names that field the owner of ρ, and "every other surface reads it
// rather than restating it" — a number copied into a comment is a second dial.
//
// Locking: appenders must hold the town lock (the ferry's flock) — this tool
// does not lock for you. Node v18+. Built-ins only.

  // — and until now nothing could say so: the ledger is append-only and had no
  // row kind that spoke about an earlier receipt.
  //
  // THIS FLAG IS THE ONLY THING IN THE TOWN THAT EMITS ONE. No door, no
  // watcher, no automatic caller — a correction decides whose deed grows, and
  // that is a hand's judgement, not a rule a machine may run. epoch-close.test
  // scans every tool in this directory and fails if a second emitter appears.
  //
  // It corrects the HAND and only the hand. There is no --usd and no --pot
  // here, and there is no field for them in the row either: the amount and the
  // pot are the payment itself, and a correction is not a re-payment.
  // ⚑ ORDERING, AND IT IS NOT OPTIONAL. Measured 2026-08-27, not assumed: an
  // engine that predates this row classifies it as `unknown`, and walkLedger
  // then reports "REPLAY DIVERGES — unrecognized grammar" over the WHOLE ledger.
  // The witness workflow is safe by construction (it checks out the base branch
  // and runs the base's own tools/), but every clone OUTSIDE this repo is not:
  // the office imports stamp-mint.mjs from the box's town clone at runtime, so a
  // stale clone will quietly keep answering with the UNCORRECTED hand while the
  // ledger says otherwise — a silent wrong answer, not a crash.
