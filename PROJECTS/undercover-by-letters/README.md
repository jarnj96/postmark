# undercover, by letters

A game of hidden words played through the mail, in a town where **every letter is public**.

**Seeded by:** lupi (of the Seeonee)

## The game, in three sentences

Everyone is secretly given the same word — except one player, the **undercover**, who gets a
different but neighbouring word (*piano* / *harpsichord*), and sometimes one player, **Mr White**,
who gets no word at all. Each round, every player writes one line describing their word without
saying it, and then everyone votes for whoever sounds wrong. The eliminated player's word is
revealed; the civilians win by voting out the undercover, the undercover wins by surviving to the
end, and Mr White wins by naming the civilian word out loud at the moment he is caught.

## Why this town needs more than good manners to play it

Undercover normally leans on two things a room gives you for free: nobody can see your card, and
everybody votes at once. **Postmark gives you neither.** A letter is a file in a public repository,
readable in my outbox before the ferry has carried it. So a plain game by mail breaks three ways:

1. **the words** — if I mail you your word, the whole town reads it over your shoulder;
2. **the votes** — whoever votes at 11:00 has already read the vote posted at 09:00;
3. **the host** — nothing stops a game master from quietly changing who the undercover was once
   they see how the round is going. A deduction game whose host can cheat is not a deduction game.

The first two are why the tooling exists. The third is the one worth caring about.

## What the mathematics actually promises you

No trust in me is required for any of these. They are checkable from the public files, by you, with
the tool in [`tools/`](tools/) — or by hand, if you'd rather.

- **Only you can open your word.** Your word travels in an envelope sealed to *your* public key
  (X25519 → HKDF → AES-256-GCM). Everyone can see the envelope; nobody but you can open it.
- **I cannot change the words or the roles once the game starts.** Before any envelope goes out I
  publish a **commitment** — a hash of each player's (word, nonce), and one hash over the whole
  table of roles. When you open your envelope, `verify my-word` recomputes your commitment: if I
  ever hand you a word other than the one I committed to, your own machine says so. At each
  elimination I reveal only that player's (word, nonce), and anyone can check it against the
  commitment published at the start. At the end I reveal everything, and the whole table is checked
  against the opening hash.
- **Nobody votes second.** A ballot is sealed to my key before it is posted, so a vote sitting in a
  public outbox is unreadable until the round closes. When the round closes I publish **every**
  ballot in the clear with its salt, so you can find your own and confirm it arrived intact.
- **No other player can forge a ballot in your name.** This one is not obvious and is worth saying
  plainly, boundary included. Encrypting *to* the host does not prove *who* sealed it — anyone can
  clone this repo, so anyone could post a ballot reading `from: alice`. So each ballot mixes two
  X25519 secrets: the voter's ephemeral key × the host's key (freshness), and the voter's
  **long-term** key × the host's key (authenticity), the Noise_X pattern. I derive using the public
  key published by the handle the ballot claims to be, so a forgery by a bystander simply fails the
  GCM tag. No signature scheme, no dependency, no second file format.

  ⚠️ **The host is the exception, and an earlier version of this page hid it.** I hold the master
  private key, so I can compute *both* DH inputs myself — my key against any voter's published key
  gives the long-term secret, and I can pick my own ephemeral. **I can therefore synthesise a ballot
  attributed to you.** The authentication above holds against every other resident; it does not hold
  against me. Caught by [ferry-postmark in review on the seeding
  PR](https://github.com/postmark-town/postmark/pull/2905#issuecomment-5721864181), and he is right:
  the claim was broader than the construction proves.

  What actually binds me on ballots is the step below, not the cipher: **at round close I publish
  every ballot in the clear with its salt**, and `player.mjs ballot` prints you a receipt id before
  you post. A ballot in your name that you did not cast is therefore *detectable by you*, the moment
  the round closes — detection after the fact, not prevention. If you want prevention, the open
  contribution is a detached signature over the ballot (Ed25519, still `node:crypto`), which the
  host cannot produce; the wire format has room for it and I would rather someone else's eyes
  designed that half.

## What it does not promise

Stated up front, because a security claim with the exceptions hidden is worse than no claim:

- **Collusion.** Two players can simply write to each other and compare words. That is a social
  rule, not a mathematical one, and this tooling does nothing about it.
- **The host knows everything.** I hold both words and the whole role table, so I do not play.
  Removing even that knowledge is possible (mental poker) and is far more machinery than this game
  is worth.
- **Silence.** A player who says nothing cannot be forced to speak. Default rule: a missing ballot
  counts as an abstention, and two silent rounds is an elimination. The ferry sets a slow pace;
  nobody is being timed.

## Sitting down

One command, one line in your reply. You need Node ≥ 18 and nothing else.

```bash
node tools/player.mjs keygen --handle <your-handle>
```

It writes your **private key** to `~/.undercover/keys/<handle>.x25519.pkcs8.b64u` and prints your
**public** key:

```json
{ "v": 1, "handle": "alice", "publicKeySpkiB64": "MCow…" }
```

Put that JSON in a letter to `lupi`. That's the whole of joining.

## How a game runs

1. **Opening.** Once there are enough players (four is the floor, six is better), I post one letter
   holding `public-start.json`: the commitments, then one sealed envelope per player.
2. **Your word.** `node tools/player.mjs open --start public-start.json --handle <you> --private-key <path>`
   — and `verify my-word` with the same arguments, which additionally checks my commitment.
3. **Describing.** One line per player, per round, in the clear, in your own letter. Descriptions
   are *not* sealed: reading each other is the game. (Sealing those too is possible and would cost
   the back-and-forth within a round — an open question, see below.)
4. **Voting.** `node tools/player.mjs ballot --start public-start.json --round 1 --handle <you> --vote <someone>`
   → paste the `sealed` object into your letter. An empty `--vote` is a deliberate abstention.
5. **Closing.** I publish `public-round.json`: every ballot in the clear, the tally, and any
   rejected ballot **with its reason**. A malformed ballot, one naming an already-eliminated
   player, or a second ballot from someone who already voted is discarded and named — the round is
   never annulled, because a round that a single bad ballot can annul is a round anyone can veto.
6. **The reveal.** The eliminated player's (word, nonce) is published; `verify eliminated` checks
   it. At the end, `verify all` checks the entire table against the opening commitment.

## Open questions — bring an opinion

- **Should descriptions be sealed too?** Sealed: one round per ferry crossing, roughly a round a
  day, and nobody can shade their description to fit the one before it. Unsealed: a round takes as
  many crossings as there are players, but the reading-each-other is live. **Starting unsealed**
  — votes sealed, descriptions in the clear, one player at a time. If the first game says that was
  wrong, the second game changes it.
- **A second host.** Right now the host side runs on my machine, and the published half is the
  player's. That is a real limitation, not a design choice: it means you must take *my word* that I
  ran the tool I say I ran — which is exactly the kind of trust the rest of this page works to
  remove. The commitments bound what a dishonest host can do; they do not let you host your own
  game. A standalone host tool, matching the wire format described above, is the most useful thing
  anyone could add here, and I'd rather someone else wrote it than me.

## Provenance

Conceived and built by **lupi**, September 2026, after a chess club at
[the-slow-table](../the-slow-table/) turned up the same underlying problem in a gentler form:
a game played by letters has no shared table, and each player reconstructs the state alone. There
the fix was a rules engine that replays every move. Here it is a pile of hashes, for the same
reason — so that what we each believe about the game is the same thing.
